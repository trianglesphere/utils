This is some test text that I am using to test rmft on. This will also describe
some of its behavoir.

It needs to deal with lists:
	1. How does it deal with this?
		1. And this ?
		2. And what about this when this
		rolls over???
	(A). What happens if I mix stuff?
What about this??? - it is directly after the end of a list / dif indent level
	And what about this???
		How should sucessively indented levels be dealt with?
	And what about this level, going backwards??



How do I deal with multiple newlines??

What about this?
Or this?? How do I figure out when text is wrapped or not supposed to be 
wrapped?

The Rules of this Program are as follows:
	1. It will replace a newline with a space between two lines.
	2. Rule 1 will not apply if the lines are of different indentation
	levels.
	3. Rule 1 will also not apply when the line starts with certain strings
	such as "1. " or "*" or anything else that denotes a list.
	4. There should be a flag to turn off rule 2 & 3. This is not high
	priority
	5. Leading tabs should be removed when merging two lines.
	6. Trailing whitespace should be removed from the document before
	applying the rfmt.
